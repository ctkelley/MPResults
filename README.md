Herewith all the Julia codes for my paper Newton's Method in Mixed Precision. You get all kinds of things here.

1. The codes in /src
2. The data I used to make the plots in /Data_From_Paper
   1. The half-precision data takes a very long time to generate (weeks)
   2. I show you how to make an abridged version of the plots in the notebook ...
3. A juypter notebook explaining how it all works
   1. If the notebook fails to render, do not bother me. Instead look at the sad tale of woe on
       https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/3555
   2. It's better to clone the repo and get to the notebook from your own computer anyhow.
4. A pdf file of the notebook.
